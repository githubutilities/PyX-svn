The installation of PyX is pretty straightforward if you have installed the
Python distutils package.

First, you have to decide which C extension modules you want to build. This can
be done by setting the respective flags in the setup.cfg config file. The
default settings build the t1strip extension module, which enables partial font
downloading (i.e. only the glyphs of a font that are used are included in the
eps file). The only requisites for building this module are the Python headers
and a C compiler.

The second extension module provides Python binding for the kpathsea library,
which enables fast searching for files in the TeX/LaTeX directory hierarchy. By
default it is not built, because you need the header files of this library,
which are not included in many standard TeX distributions. Besides that,
the fallback, which uses the kpsewhich program, works equally well, although
it is not as efficient as using the library directly. If you want
to build the C extension module, you may also have to specify the location
of the kpathsea header files and the library in the setup.cfg file.

After you have adapted the setup.cfg file to your needs, you can either build
PyX locally by just running

    python setup.py build_ext -i

On the other hand, a system wide installation can be performed with help of

    python setup.py install

or an appropriate variant thereof.
