\section{General aspects of \PyX}
\question{a}{Where do I get the latest version of \PyX?}
{}
{The current release of \PyX{} (as well as older ones) is freely available 
from \url{http://pyx.sourceforge.net} where also a CVS repository with the 
latest patches can be found. Possibly older versions of \PyX{} are
also available as package for
various Linux distributions: see, for instance,  
\url{http://packages.debian.org/testing/python/python-pyx.html} for
information on the \PyX{} package in Debian GNU/Linux, 
\url{http://packages.gentoo.org/ebuilds/?pyx-0.3.1} for a Gentoo Linux
ebuild, and
\url{http://www.suse.de/en/private/products/suse_linux/i386/packages_professional/python-pyx.html}
for the \PyX{} package in the SUSE LINUX professional distribution.
}

\question{c}{How can I determine the version of \PyX{} running on my 
machine?}
{}
{Start a python session (usually by typing \texttt{python} at the system
prompt) and then type the following two commands (\texttt{>>>} is the python 
prompt)
\begin{progcode}
>>> import pyx\\
>>> pyx.\us\us{}version\us\us
\end{progcode}
}

\question{c}{Does \PyX{} run under my favorite operating system?}
{}
{Yes, if you have installed Python (\uaref{q:what_is_python})
and \TeX{} (\uaref{q:what_is_tex}). Both are available for
a large variety of operating systems so chances are pretty good that you will 
get \PyX{} to work on your system.
}

\question{t}{Under which versions of Python will \PyX{} run?}
{AW: this is 0.5 already, but the english might be improved}
{\PyX{} is supposed to work with Python 2.x. However, most of the
development takes place under current Python versions (by time of
writing x=3). Hence its heavier tested with newer versions. On the
other hand the examples and tests are passed with a complete set of
Python 2.x for all available x. \PyX{} will not work with Python 1.x
due to missing language features. The version of your Python
interpreter can be determined by calling it with the option
\texttt{-V}. Alternatively, you can simply start the interpreter and
take a look at the startup message. Note that there may be different
versions of Python installed on your system at the same time. The
default Python version might also depend on the account in use
(regular user vs. system administrator) which should be carefully
checked when installing \PyX.
}

\question{a}{Where can I get help if my question is not answered in this FAQ?}
{}
{The \PyX{} sources contain a reference manual and a set of examples 
demonstrating various features of \PyX. If the feature you are looking for is
among them, using the appropriate part of the example code or adapting it for
your purposes may help.

There is also a user discussion list about \PyX{} which you can subscribe to
at \url{http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyx-user}. The archive of
the discussion list is available at \url{http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=23700}.
}

\section{Python}

\question{c}{What is Python?}
{}
{\label{q:what_is_python}
From \url{www.python.org}:
\begin{quote}
Python is an \textit{interpreted, interactive, object-oriented} programming 
language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, 
classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. 
There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various 
windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily 
written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for 
applications that need a programmable interface.

The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX, on 
Windows, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, and many other platforms. If your favorite system 
isn't listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for it. 
Ask around on \href{news:comp.lang.python}{news:comp.lang.python} --- or just 
try compiling Python yourself.

The Python implementation is 
\href{http://www.python.org/doc/Copyright.html}{copyrighted} 
but \textbf{freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use}.
\end{quote}
}

\question{a}{Where can I learn more about Python?}
{}
{The place to start is \url{www.python.org} where you will find plenty of
information on Python including tutorials.
}

\question{c}{What do I need to import in order to use \PyX?}
{}
{It is recommended to begin your Python code with 
\begin{progcode}
from pyx import *
\end{progcode}
when using \PyX. This allows you for example to write simply 
\texttt{graph.graphxy}
instead of \texttt{pyx.graph.graphxy}. The following modules will be loaded:
\texttt{box}, \texttt{canvas}, \texttt{color}, \texttt{connector}, \texttt{data},
\texttt{deco}, \texttt{epsfile}, \texttt{graph}, \texttt{path},
\texttt{style}, \texttt{trafo}, \texttt{tex}, \texttt{text}, and
\texttt{unit}.

For convenience, you might import specific objects of a module like in
\begin{progcode}
from graph import graphxy
\end{progcode}
which allows you to write \texttt{graphxy()} instead of \texttt{graph.graphxy()}.

All code segments in this document assume that the import line mentioned in
the first code snippet is present.
}

\question{a}{What is a raw string and why should I know about it when
  using \PyX?}
{}
{\label{q:raw_string}
The backslash serves in standard Python strings to start an escape sequence.
For example {\cs n} corresponds to a newline character. On the other hand,
\TeX{} and \LaTeX{}, which do the typesetting in \PyX, use the backslash to
indicate the start of a command. In order to avoid the standard interpretation,
the string should be marked as a raw string by prepending it by an \texttt{r} 
like in
\begin{progcode}
c.text(0, 0, r"\${\cs alpha}{\cs beta}{\cs gamma}\$")
\end{progcode}
}

\section{Plotting of graphs}

\subsection{General aspects}

\question{c}{How do I generate a graph from data as simply as possible?}
{}
{\label{q:mingraphdata}
Suppose that you have a data file \texttt{x.dat} containing values for
$x$ and $y$ in two columns. Then the following code will do the job
\begin{progcode}
from pyx import *\\
\\
g = graph.graphxy(width=10)\\
g.plot(graph.data("x.dat", x=1, y=2))\\
g.writetofile("x")
\end{progcode}
\texttt{graphxy} creates a canvas (called \texttt{g} in this example) onto 
which the graph will be drawn and sets the default behavior including the 
axis. There is, however, no default value for the width of the graph. In 
\texttt{plot} you have to specify the name of the data file and the columns 
from which the data should be taken. Finally, \texttt{writetofile} will 
generate the postscript file \texttt{x.eps} which you can view or print.

A minimal example is also provided in the \PyX{} distribution as 
\path{examples/graphs/minimal.py}.
}

\question{a}{How do I generate a graph of a function as simply as possible?}
{}
{The following example will draw a parabola:
\begin{progcode}
from pyx import *\\
\\
g = graph.graphxy(width=10,\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~x=graph.linaxis(min=-2, max=2)\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~)\\
\\
g.plot(graph.function("y=x\^{}2"))\\
\\
g.writetofile("x")
\end{progcode}
Most of the code has been explained in \uaref{q:mingraphdata}. The main 
difference is that here you need to specify minimum and maximum for the 
$x$-axis so that \PyX{} knows in which range to evaluate the function.

See \uaref{q:zerolineattrs} for an explanation of how one can suppress the
zero lines.

Another, slightly more complex, example is also provided in the \PyX{} 
distribution as \path{examples/graphs/piaxis.py}.
}

\question{t}{How can I stack graphs?}
{maybe we should recommend using the bbox.height() method instead of
  using g.height?)}
{\PyX{} always needs a canvas to draw on. One possibility therefore consists
in creating a new canvas with
\begin{progcode}
c = canvas.canvas()
\end{progcode}
and inserting the graphs into this canvas with \texttt{c.insert(...)}. Here,
\texttt{...} has to be replaced by the name of the graph. Alternatively, the
canvas created with \texttt{graph.graphxy} for one of the graphs can be used
to insert the other graphs even if they will be positioned outside the
first graph.

The second issue to address is positioning of the graphs. By specifying
\texttt{xpos} and \texttt{ypos} when calling \texttt{graphxy}, you can
define the position of a graph. Later on, the position and size of a 
graph \texttt{g} can be referred to as \texttt{g.xpos}, \texttt{g.ypos},
\texttt{g.width}, and \texttt{g.height} even if for example the height has 
never been specified explicitly but is only defined by a \PyX{} default. 

The following example shows how to put graph \texttt{gupper} above graph 
\texttt{glower} on a canvas \texttt{c}:
\begin{progcode}
from pyx import *\\
from graph import graphxy\\
\\
c = canvas.canvas()\\
\\
glower = graphxy(width=10)\\
glower.plot(...)\\
c.insert(glower)\\
\\
gupper = graphxy(width=10, ypos=glower.ypos+glower.height+2)\\
gupper.plot(...)\\
\\
c.insert(gupper)\\
c.writetofile(...)
\end{progcode}
where \texttt{...} has to be replaced by the appropriate information like
data and symbol specifications and the name of the output file. Here,
\texttt{c.insert} is used to actually insert the subcanvasses 
for the graphs into the main canvas \texttt{c} and \texttt{c.writetofile}
in the last line requests to write the contents of this canvas to a file.

%In order to suppress the labels of the $x$-axis of the upper graph, use
%\begin{progcode}
%myaxispainter = graph.axispainter(labelattrs=None)
%
%gupper = graph.graphxy(...,
%                       x=graph.linaxis(...,
%                                      part=graph.linpart(),
%                                       painter=myaxispainter)
%                       )
%\end{progcode}
}

\question{t}{How can I plot grid data?}
{}
{}

\question{t}{I would like a key for only some of my data sets. How do I do
that?}
{}
{
}

\subsection{Axis properties}

\question{a}{How do I specify the tick increment?}
{}
{In the partition of a linear axis, the increments associated with ticks,
subticks etc.\ can be specified as argument of \texttt{linpart}. In the
following example, ticks will be drawn at even values while subticks will
be drawn at all integers:
\begin{progcode}
tg = graph.graphxy(width=10,\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~x=graph.linaxis(min=1, max=10,\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~part=graph.linpart(tickdist=[2,1]))\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~)
\end{progcode}
}

\question{a}{Why are the axes extended beyond the data range?}
{}
{Because the developers like it this way (God knows why). One way to avoid
this extension is to explicitly specify the minimum and maximum values for
the axis. The other possibility is to set \texttt{datavmin=0} and/or
\texttt{datavmax=1} in \texttt{linaxis} or \texttt{logaxis}. 

Changes in the extension of axes are announced for version 0.5.
}

\question{a}{How do I get rid of the zero line?}
{}
{\label{q:zerolineattrs}
The \texttt{axispainter} takes an argument \texttt{zerolineattrs} which 
defaults to an empty list. Setting the \texttt{axispainter} for the
appropriate axis to \texttt{None} will remove the zero line like in this
example:
\begin{progcode}
myaxispainter = graph.axispainter(zerolineattrs=None)\\
\\
g = graph.graphxy(width=10,\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~x=graph.linaxis(min=-5, max=5, painter=myaxispainter),\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~y=graph.linaxis(min=-5, max=5)\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~)
\end{progcode}
This will keep the horizontal zero line but discard the vertical one.
}

\subsection{Data properties}

\question{a}{How do I choose the symbol?}
{}
{\label{q:choose_symbol}
Suppose a graph called \texttt{g} has been initialized, e.g. using
\texttt{graph.graphxy}. Then, data and the style of their representation
in the graph are defined by calling \texttt{g.plot} like in the following
example in which filled circles are requested:
\begin{progcode}
g.plot(graph.data("test.dat"),\\
~~~~~~~graph.symbol(graph.symbol.circle,symbolattrs=deco.filled()\\
~~~~~~~)
\end{progcode}
}

\question{a}{How do I choose the color of the symbols?}
{}
{Colors are not properties of the symbol as such and can therefore not
be specified in \texttt{symbolattrs} directly. The color is rather related
to the plotting of the symbol as defined by \texttt{deco.stroked()} or
\texttt{deco.filled()}. With
\begin{progcode}
graph.symbol(graph.symbol.circle,\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~symbolattrs=[deco.stroked(color.rgb.red),\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~deco.filled(color.rgb.green)]\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~)
\end{progcode}
you will obtain a circle filled in green with a red borderline.
}

\question{a}{How do I choose the line style?}
{}
{If you do not want to use symbols, you can set the line style as in this
example
\begin{progcode}
g.plot(graph.data("test.dat"),\\
~~~~~~~graph.line(lineattrs=style.linewidth.Thin)\\
~~~~~~~)
\end{progcode}
where the linewidth is set.

If you also want to use symbols, you can set the line attributes together
with the symbols.  Extending the example in \ref{q:choose_symbol}),
you could use
\begin{progcode}
g.plot(graph.data("test.dat"),\\
~~~~~~~graph.symbol(graph.symbol.circle, \\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~symbolattrs=deco.filled(),\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~lineattrs=[style.linewidth.Thin, style.linestyle.dashed]\\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~)\\
~~~~~~~)
\end{progcode}
to set the linewidth and to choose dashed lines. 
}

\section{\TeX{} and \LaTeX{}}

\subsection{General aspects}

\question{a}{What is \TeX/\LaTeX{} and why do I need it?}
{}
{\label{q:what_is_tex}
\TeX{} is a high quality typesetting system developed by Donald E. Knuth 
which is available for a wide variety of operating systems. \LaTeX{} is a 
macro package originally developed by Leslie Lamport which makes life with 
\TeX{} easier, in particular for complex typesetting tasks. The current 
version of \LaTeX{} is referred to as \LaTeXe{} and offers e.g.\ improved 
font selection as compared to the older \LaTeX{} 2.09 which should no longer 
be used. 

All typesetting tasks in \PyX{} are finally handed over to \TeX{} (which is the
default) or \LaTeX{}, so that \PyX{} cannot do without it. On the other hand,
the capabilities of \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} can be used for complex tasks where
both graphics and typesetting are needed.
}

\question{a}{I don't know anything about \TeX{} and \LaTeX{}. Where can I read 
something about it?}
{}
{\label{q:intro_tex_latex}
Take a look at CTAN (\uaref{q:ctan}) where in \ctan{info}
you may be able to find some useful information. There exists for example 
``A Gentle Introduction to \TeX'' by M.~Doob (\ctan{gentle/gentle.pdf}) and
``The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeXe'' 
(\ctan{info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}) by T.~Oetiker et al. The latter has
been translated into a variety of languages among them korean (which you will
not be able to read unless you have appropriate fonts installed) and mongolian.

Of course, it is likely that these documents will go way beyond what you 
will need for generating graphics with \PyX{} so you don't have to read all
of it (unless you want to use \TeX{} or \LaTeX{} for typesetting which can be
highly recommended). 

There exists also a number of FAQs on \TeX{} at \ctan{help}.
}

\question{a}{What is CTAN?}
{}
{\label{q:ctan}
CTAN is the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network where you will find almost
everything related to \TeX{} and friends. The main CTAN servers are 
\url{tug.ctan.org}, \url{dante.ctan.org}, and \url{cam.ctan.org}. A list of 
FTP mirrors can be found at \ctan{CTAN.sites}. 

In this FAQ, \texttt{CTAN:} refers to the root of an anonymous ftp CTAN tree, 
e.g.  \url{ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/}, 
\url{ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/},
and \url{ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/}. The links to CTAN in this document
point to one of these servers but you might consider using a FTP mirror closer
to you in order to reduce traffic load.
}

\question{a}{Is there support for Con\TeX{}t?}
{}
{No, and as far as I know there no plans to provide it in the near future. 
Given the close ties between Con\TeX{}t and Meta\-Post, Con\TeX{}t users 
probably prefer to stick with the latter anyway.
}

\subsection{\TeX{} and \LaTeX{} commands useful for \PyX}

\question{a}{How do I get a specific symbol with \TeX{} or \LaTeX?}
{}
{A list of mathematical symbols together with the appropriate command name
can be found at \ctan{info/symbols/math/symbols.ps}. A comprehensive list
containing more than 2500 symbols for use with \LaTeX{} can be obtained from 
\ctan{info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf}. In some cases it might be 
necessary to install fonts or packages available from CTAN 
(\uaref{q:ctan}).
}

\subsection{\TeX{} and \LaTeX{} errors}

\question{a}{Undefined control sequence \cs{usepackage}}
{}
{\label{q:undefined_usepackage}
The command \cs usepackage is specific to \LaTeX{}. Since by default \PyX{}
uses \TeX{}, you have to specify the correct mode:
\begin{progcode}
text.set(mode="latex")
\end{progcode}
}

\question{a}{Undefined control sequence \cs{frac}}
{}
{\label{q:undefined_frac}
The command \cs frac is only available in \LaTeX{}. In \TeX{} you should
use \texttt{\cb{a\cs over b}} in math mode to produce ${a\over b}$. As an 
alternative you may ask for the \LaTeX{} mode as explained in 
\ref{q:undefined_usepackage}.
}

\question{a}{Missing \$ inserted}
{}
{You have specified \TeX- or \LaTeX-code which is only valid in math mode. 
Typical examples are greek symbols, sub- and superscripts or fractions. 

On the \PyX{} level, you can specify math mode for the whole string by using
\texttt{text.mathmode} as in
\begin{progcode}
c.text(0, 0, r"{\cs alpha}", text.mathmode)
\end{progcode}
Keep also in mind that the standard Python interpretation of the backslash as 
introducing escape sequences needs to be prevented 
\uaref{q:raw_string}.

On the \TeX/\LaTeX{} level you should enclose the commands requiring math
mode in \$'s. As an example, \texttt{\$\cs alpha\us i\hat j\$} will produce 
$\alpha_i^j$. This allows you to specify math mode also for substrings. There 
exist other ways to specify math mode in \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} which are 
particularly useful for more complex typesetting tasks. To learn more about 
it, you should consult the documentation 
\uaref{q:intro_tex_latex}. 
}

\question{a}{Font shape `OT1/xyz/m/n' undefined}
{}
{\label{q:fontshape_undefined}
You have asked to use font \texttt{xyz} which is not available. Make sure that
you have this font available in Type1 format, i.e.\ there should be a 
file \texttt{xyz.pfb} somewhere. If your \TeX{} system is TDS compliant 
(TDS=\TeX{} directory structure, cf.\ \ctan{tds/draft-standard/tds/tds.pdf}) 
you should take a look at the subdirectories of 
\path{TEXMF/fonts/type1}.
}

\question{t}{File \dots is not available or not readable}
{AW: this is 0.5 already, but the english might be improved}
{\label{q:no_lfs}
Such an error message can already be encountered by simply running the
example file \texttt{hello.py} included in the \PyX{} distribution.
Usually, the error occures due to some restrictiv umask setting when
unpacking the tar.gz sources. This may render the file mentioned in
the above error message unreadable and the python distutil
installation package doesn't change these file permissions back to be
readable by everyone.}

\question{t}{No information for font `cmr10' found in font mapping file}
{rewrite this taking into account the pyxrc file}
{\label{q:no_cmr10}
Such an error message can already be encountered by simply running the example
file \texttt{hello.py} included in the \PyX{} distribution. The likely reason
is that the \TeX{} system does not find the cmr fonts in Type1 format.
\PyX{} depends on these fonts as it does not work with the traditional
pk fonts which are stored as bitmaps.

Therefore, the first thing to make sure is that the cmr Type1 fonts are
installed. In some \TeX{} installations, the command \texttt{kpsewhich 
cmr10.pfb} will return the appropriate path if the cmr fonts exist in the 
binary Type1 format (extension \texttt{pfb}) required by \PyX. If the command 
does not work but the TeX{} system is TDS compliant 
(\uaref{q:fontshape_undefined}), a look should be taken at 
\path{TEXMF/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm} where \texttt{TEXMF} is the root of the 
\texttt{texmf} tree.

If the Type1 fonts do not exist on the system, they may be obtained from
the CTAN \uaref{q:ctan} at \ctan{fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky}. See the 
\texttt{README} for information about who produced these fonts and why they
are freely available.

If the Type1 fonts exist, the next step is to take a look at 
\texttt{psfonts.map}. There may be several files with this name on the system, 
so it is important to find out which one TeX is actually using. 
\texttt{kpsewhich psfonts.map} might give this information.

The most likely problem is that this file does not contain a line telling TeX
what to do if it encounters a request for font cmr10, i.e. the following line 
may be missing
\begin{progcode}
~~~cmr10~~~~~~~~~~~CMR10~~~~~~~~~~~<cmr10.pfb
\end{progcode}
It is probable that the required lines (in practice, you do not just need 
cmr10) are found in a file named \texttt{psfonts.cmz} which resides in 
\path{TEXMF/dvips/bluesky}. The contents of \texttt{psfonts.cmz} should
be inserted into \texttt{psfonts.map}. Probably, \texttt{psfonts.map} recommends
not to do this by hand. In this case the instructions should be followed. 
Otherwise, \texttt{psfonts.cmz} should be copied into \texttt{psfonts.map}
while keeping a backup of the old \texttt{psfonts.map} just in case. After
these changes \PyX{} most likely will be happy. When inserting 
\texttt{psfonts.cmz} into \texttt{psfonts.map} it may be a good idea to 
include \texttt{psfonts.amz} as well. \texttt{psfonts.amz} contains information 
about some more fonts which might be needed at some point.

Making these changes will imply that the \TeX{} system will use the cmr fonts 
in Type1 format instead of pk format which is actually not a bad thing, in 
particular if \texttt{latex}~/ \texttt{dvips}~/ \texttt{ps2pdf} is used to 
generate PDF output. With fonts in pk format this will look ugly and using 
Type1 fonts solves this problem as well. When \texttt{pdflatex} is used to 
create PDF files, Type1 fonts will be used anyway.

An alternative to changing the file \texttt{psfonts.map} in the \TeX{} system 
consists in instructing \PyX{} to read other map files like 
\texttt{psfonts.cmz} as well. This can be achieved by adding map files in the 
following line of 
\texttt{pyx/text.py}:
\begin{progcode}
fontmap = readfontmap(["psfonts.map"])
\end{progcode}

It may well be that future versions of \PyX{} take care of this problem so that
one needs no longer to worry about \texttt{psfonts.map}, at least for the
standard cmr fonts.
}

\question{o}{No information for font `xyz7t' found in font mapping file}
{I think we should delete this question for the release, because it
  should no longer be applicable to PyX 0.5 and above.}
{After verifying that your problem was not addressed in \uaref{q:no_cmr10}, 
you should switch on virtual font support by using \texttt{text.set(dvicopy=1)}.
For those interested in more details: setting this option will cause
\texttt{dvicopy} to be run after a \texttt{dvi}-file has been created by a call 
to \TeX/\LaTeX. \texttt{dvicopy} expands any references to virtual fonts to
base fonts and thus produces a modified copy of the original \texttt{dvi}-file.

If this does not help, verify the existence of \texttt{xyz7t.vf} in one of the 
subdirectories of \path{TEXMF/fonts/vf} (again, a TDS compliant \TeX{} 
system is assumed \uaref{q:fontshape_undefined}). If the 
virtual font file exists, find out which font it requests. A human readable 
version of the virtual font file can be obtained with the help of 
\texttt{vftovp}. A Unix operating system should allow you to obtain the 
fontname by means of
\begin{progcode}
vftovp xyz7t.vf|grep FONTNAME
\end{progcode}
The resulting fontname has to be listed in \texttt{psfonts.map}. Use
\begin{progcode}
kpsewhich psfonts.map
\end{progcode}
to find out where this file resides (there may be more than one and it is
important to know which one is actually read).
}

\subsection{Fonts}

\question{t}{I have Type1 fonts in \texttt{pfa} format. How do I obtain the 
corresponding \texttt{pfb} files needed by \PyX?}
{}
{
}

\question{a}{I want to use a font other than computer modern roman}
{}
{\label{q:other_font}
As long as you have a font in Type1 format available, this should be no
problem (even though it may cost you some time to set up things properly).

In the simplest case, your \LaTeX{} system contains everything needed. 
Including the following line into your code will probably work
\begin{progcode}
text.set(mode="latex")\\
text.preamble(r"\cs{usepackage}\cb{mathptmx}")
\end{progcode}
and give you Times as roman font. 

If you own one of the more common commercial fonts, take a look at
\ctan{fonts} and its subdirectories as well as at the web page
\url{http://home.vr-web.de/was/fonts.html} of Walter Schmidt. It is not
unlikely that somebody has already done most of the work for you and created
the files needed for the font to work properly with \LaTeX. But remember:
we are talking about commercial fonts here, so do not expect to find the fonts
themselves for free.

If none of these cases applies, you should spend some time reading
manuals about font installation, e.g.\ \ctan{macros/latex/doc/fntguide.pdf}
(of course, I do not expect font wizards to read the last few lines).

\question{a}{Can I use a TrueType font with \PyX?}
{}
{Not directly as \PyX{} only knows how to handle Type1 fonts (although it is
possible to get \LaTeX{} to work with TrueType fonts). However, you may use
\texttt{ttf2pt1} (from \url{http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net}) to convert a 
TrueType font into a Type1 font which you then install in your \TeX{} system 
\uaref{q:other_font}. You will loose hinting information 
in the conversion process but this should not really matter on output devices 
with not too low resolution.
