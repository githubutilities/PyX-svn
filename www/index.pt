<h2>Summary</h2>

  3d plot example
</div>

<p> PyX is a Python package for the creation of encapsulated PostScript
figures. It provides both an abstraction of PostScript and a TeX/LaTeX
interface. Complex tasks like 2d and 3d plots in publication-ready quality are built
out of these primitives. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PostScript output for device independent, free scalable figures</li>
  <li>seamless TeX/LaTeX integration</li>
  <li>full access to PostScript features like paths, linestyles, fill patterns, transformations, clipping, etc.</li>
  <li>advanced geometric operations on paths like intersections, transformations, splitting, etc.</li>
  <li>sophisticated graph generation: modular design, plugable axes, axes partitioning based on rational number arithmetics, flexible graph styles, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Status and Availability</h2>

<p> PyX is in constant development. Alpha releases are available
in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=45430">download
section</a> of the SourceForge project page. </p>

<h2>News</h2>
