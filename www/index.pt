<h1>PyX - Python graphics package</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p> PyX is a python package for the creation of encapsulated PostScript
figures. It provides both an abstraction of PostScript and a TeX/LaTeX
interface. Complex tasks like 2d plots in publication-ready quality are built
out of these primitives. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>seemless TeX/LaTeX integration</li>
  <li>advanced path operations: intersection, transformations, etc.</li>
  <li>sophisticated graph plotting</li>
</ul>

<h2>License and authors</h2>

<p> PyX was written by J&ouml;rg Lehmann and Andr&eacute; Wobst and is free software
licensed under the GNU GPL Version&nbsp;2. </p>
