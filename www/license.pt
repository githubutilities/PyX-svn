    <h1>PyX - License</h1>

    <p> PyX is free software licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2. However,
    since the copyright of the source code is currently owned by a few people
    only, we are able to offer PyX under a different license upon request.
    </p>

    <p> In case you want to obtain PyX under a different license, seek for
    professional support, or need additional features to be added to PyX,
    please get in touch with <a
    href="mailto:contact@wobsta.de,joergl@users.sourceforge.net">the
    authors</a>. Note that we like to have new features developed commercially
    to be added to the GPL version of PyX, as already was done in the case of
    the bitmap support added in PyX 0.7. </p>
