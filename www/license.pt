    <h1>PyX - License</h1>

    <p>
      PyX is free software licensed under the GNU GPL Version&nbsp;2. However,
      since the source code is currently owned by a few people only, we are able
      to offer different licensing upon request. While this renders the
      inclusion of external contributions more difficult, it allows us to
      perform commercial development for PyX after selling a commercial license.
      Due to special agreements with the principal we could already include some
      remittance work to the GPL version of PyX, namely the bitmap support as
      added in PyX 0.7.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case you want to use PyX under a different license, seek for
      professional support or need additional features to be added to PyX, get
      in touch with <a href="mailto:contact@wobsta.de">Andr&eacute; Wobst</a>.
