\section{Color models}
PostScript provides different color models like grey colors, rgb
colors, hsb colors, and cmyk colors. They are available to \PyX{} by
different color classes, which just pass the colors down to the
PostScript level. This implies, that there are no conversion routines
between different color models available. However, some color model
conversion routines are included in python's standard library in the
module \texttt{colorsym}. Furthermore also the comparision of colors
within a color model is not supported, but might be added in future
versions at least for checking color identity and for ordering grey
colors.

\section{Color classes}
There is a class for each of the supported color models, namely
\verb|grey|, \verb|rgb|, \verb|cmyk|, and \verb|hsb|.

\section{Color instances}
Like all attributes, colors are instances of their specific classes.
The constructors of the color classes take the

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
import pyx

c = canvas.canvas()

c.fill(path.rect(0, 0, 7, 3), color.grey(0.8))
c.fill(path.rect(1, 1, 1, 1), color.rgb.red)
c.fill(path.rect(3, 1, 1, 1), color.rgb.green)
c.fill(path.rect(5, 1, 1, 1), color.rgb.blue)

c.writetofile("color")
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The file \verb|color.eps| is created and looks like:
