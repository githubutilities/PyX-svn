\chapter{Mathematical expressions}
\label{mathtree}

At several points within \PyX{} mathematical expressions can be
provided in form of string parameters. They are evaluated by the
module mathtree. This module is not described futher in this user
manual, because it is considered to be a technical detail. We just
want to give a list of available operators and functions here.

\begin{description}
\item[Operators:]
\verb|+|; \verb|-|; \verb|*|; \verb|/|; \verb|**| and \verb|^| (both
for power)

\item[Functions:]
\verb|neg| (negate); \verb|sgn| (signum); \verb|sqrt| (square root);
\verb|exp|; \verb|log| (natural logarithm); \verb|sin|; \verb|cos|;
\verb|tan|; \verb|asin|; \verb|acos|; \verb|atan|; \verb|norm|
($\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ as an example for functions with multiple arguments)
