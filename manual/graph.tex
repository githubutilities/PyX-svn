\chapter{Module graph: graph plotting}
\label{graph}
\section{A short introduction note}
This module is considered to be in constant, gradual development. For
the moment we concentrate ourself on standard 2d xy-graphs taking all
kind of possible specialties into account, like any number of axes,
axis with any number of axis breaks and so on. Architectural decisions
play the most substantial role at the moment and have hopefully
already been done that way, that their flexibility will suffice for
future usages in quite different graph types, \emph{e.g.} circular 2d
graphs or even 3d graphs. We will describe those parts of the graph
module here, which are in a totally usable state already and are
hopefully not to be changed later on. However, future developments
certainly will cause incompatibilities, for example they are expected
to happen for automatic axis ticking and labeling or just by splitting
the graph module into several parts later on. But at least be warned:
Nobody knows the hole list of things that will break. At the moment,
keeping backwards compatibility in the graph module is not at all an
issue for us. Although we do not claim any backwards compatibility
anywhere in \PyX, the graph module is certainly one of the biggest
construction site within \PyX.
\section{Keys}
Sorry, there is not yet any support for graph keys.
