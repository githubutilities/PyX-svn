PyX gallery

Similar to the PyX example pages the gallery shows you some ready-to-run PyX
code. But while the examples try to provide you minimal examples to explain
certain PyX features, the subject for the gallery is to show you some fancy
and/or real world examples. While sometimes you will find some explanations
similar to those of the example pages, but a full description of all the
details are far out of scope for the gallery. Still, the shown code might be
well suited as a starting point for own experiments with PyX.

We encourage you to submit suitable gallery examples via the [PyX mailing lists
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=45430]. In case the example needs
external data, please try to use a single external data file only. Optionally,
you can include a short description on the specifics of the example, e.g., what
cool feature of PyX it makes use of.
