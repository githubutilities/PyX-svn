Graph axes

This section demonstrates some axes features of the graph system. For that we
draw axes along paths, although this ''might'' look a bit esoteric (especially
since we're using curved paths). But please be not distracted by that: all the
shown functionality is available to the quite boring case of straight axes as
they are typically used in graphs.
