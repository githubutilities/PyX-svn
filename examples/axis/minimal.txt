Minimal example for drawing an isolated axis

This is the basic example of how to draw an axis alone -- without the whole
graph. It serves to simplify the following examples. ... The function
`pathaxis` from the `graph.axis` module takes a path and returns a canvas which
contains the drawn axis.

Differently than in the typical usecase of graphs containing data, we must here
provide the range explicitly (`min` and `max` arguments). graphs the range of
an axis gets adjusted automatically although you can still set minimal and/or
maximal values to force a certain axis range.
