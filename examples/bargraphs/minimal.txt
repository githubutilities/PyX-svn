Minimal bar-graph example

For a minimal bar plot you have set an bar axis in the graph constructor and
provide Xname column data (X stands for the bar axis to be used). ...
Furthermore you need to specify the graph style, since the default graph styles
symbol and function (depending on the data type) are not appropriate for bar
graphs.

!! By using the bar style you implicitly also select a different positioning
style, namepy `barpos`. This positioning style handles a single-nested axes
with sub-axis values of the range going from 0 to 1.
