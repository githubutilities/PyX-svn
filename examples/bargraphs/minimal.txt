Minimal bar-graph example

For a minimal bar plot you have set an bar axis in the graph constructor and
provide Xname column data (X stands for the bar axis to be used). ... Here, we
just use column 0 which is automatically filled by `graph.data.file` with the
line number of the corresponding entry. Furthermore, you need to specify the
graph style, since the default graph styles `symbol` and `function` (depending on
the data type) are not appropriate for bar graphs.

!! By using the bar style you implicitly also select a different positioning
style, namepy `barpos`. This positioning style handles a single-nested axes
with sub-axis values of the range going from 0 to 1.
