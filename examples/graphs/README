Basic plotting

One of PyX major strengths are its graph plotting capabilities. PyX offers you
a flexible system which, while providing sensible defaults, allows you to
customize almost every aspect of the graph output. Such a flexibility comes at
a price, though: you need to learn at least a little bit about the different
components playing together in order to produce a graph. In this section, we
try to give you a gentle introduction to one component after the other. We
start by demonstrating how to plot various kind of data (from a file, a
function mapping x values to y values, a parametric function, a histogram).
Along the way, we introduce more and more concepts which you need to understand
in order to be able to make use of the full power of PyX's graph-plotting
system.
