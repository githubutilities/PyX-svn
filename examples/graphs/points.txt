Plotting a list of data points

Here, we explain how to plot data which has been calculated before and which is
contained in a list. ...

The procedure is quite the same as for plotting a data file or a function in
the above examples. The difference is that we here use a `graph.data.points`
instance to the `plot` method of the graph. It takes a list of data points
which come as tuples. You will have to say something like `x=1, y=2` to specify
which entry in your tuples is to be used on which axis.

Similarly to the plotting of a data file, the default plotting style is with
symbols. This appears to be the the natural choice, since the data is of
discrete nature.

Caution: This feature has been renamed between versions 0.9 and 0.10. The old
name in version 0.9 and before was `graph.data.list`.
