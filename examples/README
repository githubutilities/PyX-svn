PyX examples

The following examples are part of the PyX release __version__. For each PyX
example the source code and the corresponding output are shown. You can take a
guided tour through all examples by the ''prev'' and ''next'' links on the
upper right.

! Some paragraphs (like the one you're just reading) are marked with a ''bend
sign''. Some people will recognize this classification from the TeXbook by
D.E.Knuth and we use it at the PyX example pages for the same purpose. The
bend mark parts of the description, which require some experiences with PyX. On
the other hand those parts can savely be ignored by PyX beginners.

!! There are even some paragraphs marked by ''double bends''. The explanations
given in those paragraphs provide some deeper insights of what's really going
on, but are not important for the average PyX user.
