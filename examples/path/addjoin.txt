Adding and joining paths

The result of this example looks very much the same like the ''pathitems''
example from the ''Basic drawing'' section. However we're using a different
approach to construct the paths in this example: we're adding and joining
paths. ... The difference is in whether the resulting path just contains all
the subpaths from the first and the second path or the last subpath from the
first path continued by the first subpath of the second path leading to a
single subpath only.

! An similar result in terms of the line thickness could be achieved by
setting a different scale for the linewidth by

    unit.set(wscale=10)

immediately after the import statement. The unit system of PyX is aware of
several length types (unscaleable ''true'' coordinates `t`, regular ''user''
coordinates `u`, ''visual'' coordinates `v` for arrows, symbols and other
Jsmall visual components, line ''widths'' `w` and the ``teXt`` sizes `x`). The
length types can be scaled independantly from each other (except for ''true''
coordinates).

! Note that joining of two paths might inserts an connection line between the
first and the second path. Hence we could for example skip the second line when
constructing `rect2` in our example above without any change in the result.
