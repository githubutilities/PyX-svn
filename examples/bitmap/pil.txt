Using image instances from the PIL

You can use image instances from the [Python Image Library
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil] to create bitmaps.
While you do not need the PIL to create an image pixel by
pixel ... (and its slow to use putpixel for that), you do have
an easy access to all the bitmap formats available in PIL,
you may use PIL features to create/load/modify bitmaps etc.
