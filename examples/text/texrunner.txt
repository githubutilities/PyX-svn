Running and controlling TeX

Usually all you will ever need is a single `texrunner` instance which controls
a single running TeX or LaTeX instance at the time. To make live easy to our
users..., such an instance is created automatically upon startup and its called
the `defaulttexrunner`. Whenever you use the function shortcuts like
`text.text()` and most to be emphasized `text.set()` you are accessing this
`defaulttexrunner` instance. Also, the shortcut method `text` of any canvas
instance uses this `defaulttexrunner` by default.

However, this example shows you how to create a second `texrunner` instance. To
make it a little interesting, we switch the `defaulttexrunner` to use LaTeX,
while keeping TeX for the `plaintexrunner` instance. It is you turn to try
expressions which are valid on TeX or LaTeX only at the different `texrunner`
instances.

Note that you do not have to worry about mixing the results of different
texrunners into a single output. Even the embedded fonts in the output are
shared when they are equal. You can, by the way, also restart a `texrunner`
instance including the `defaulttexrunner` and change its configuration on that
occasion.
