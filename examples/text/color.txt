Using the same color in PyX and in LaTeX

! This example shows three different methods how to use a color defined in PyX
also in LaTeX.... In the example code, we first define a cmyk color `col`,
which is then used to define a color `COL` in LaTeX. The latter is then used in
a LaTeX expression.

! The same behavior can be achieved by two different methods in `c.text`,

    r"\textcolor[named]{PineGreen}{Text} and outline ..."
    r"\textcolor[pyx]{color.cmyk.PineGreen}{Text} and outline ..."

They are not as elegant as the above shown, since we need to insert the color
definition `PineGreen` explicitly. The first alternative makes use of the
`named` color model of color.sty. All colors of this model are predefined also
in PyX. The other alternative allows to use Python expressions to specify the
color.

!! Note the use of the graphics driver `pyx` as the optional argument for the
color.sty LaTeX package. If you do not explicitly use the pyx driver, then the
color.sty package uses its default driver `dvips`. PyX will then try to
override the driver, since it really needs the correct driver.
