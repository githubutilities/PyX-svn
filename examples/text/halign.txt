Horizontal alignment

The example shows the result of the different text attributes for horizontal
alignment. At first we need to emphasize, that PyX distinguishes between the
alignment of the text box and the alignment of the material within the text box.
The first line in the output shows the effect of the box alignment created by
`boxleft`, `boxcenter` and `boxright` leading to left, center, and right
alignment regarding the dotted lines.

The middle part shows the examples for centering a box, but aligning the content
of the box at the left box boundary by `flushleft`, at the center by
`flushcenter` and at the right box boundary by `flushright`, respectively. ...
Note, that such an alignment of material is available only when you create a
parbox in TeX. This is easy done by the `parbox` attribute, where you have to
specify a width of the box.

At the bottom you can see combinations of `boxleft` and `flushleft`, `boxcenter`
and `flushcenter`, and `boxright` and `boxcenter` in action. Those combinations
are available by the attributes `left`, `center` and `right` to shortcut the
setting of both corresponding attributes. You can use those shortcuts for box
alignment as well, when you do not create a parbox.

Note that the alignment features are implemented that way, that they work in TeX
and in LaTeX mode. Furthermore you can always influence the alignment of the box
contents by certain TeX and LaTeX commands as well.
