There are nice packages to influence fonts in LaTeX. Hence for a simple example
we change the mode of the default texrunner instance to `latex` and use the
`preamble` method to load the `palatino` package.

In general LaTeX is also favourable for using your own Type1 fonts. Still you
can also use different fonts in TeX if you are familiar with the topic, but
LaTeXs NFSS (new font selection scheme) is preferable by the ordinary user and
has great advantages in daily use later on. All you need to do is to integrate
the fonts into your LaTeX system. Probably you'll need to create your own LaTeX
font adaptation for what the `fontinst` utility is of great help. Try your
favorite search engine on that topic to learn more about it and find some step
by step guides. As soon as your LaTeX system is configured to use your fonts
they will also be available to PyX.
