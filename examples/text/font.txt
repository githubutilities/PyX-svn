Customize fonts

In LaTeX, there are nice packages allowing to switch fonts. Hence for a simple
example we change the mode of the default texrunner instance to LaTeX and use
the `preamble` method to load the `palatino` package. ...

!! In general, it is also favourable to employ LaTeX when using your own Type1
fonts. Still you can also use different fonts in plain TeX if you are familiar
with the topic. However, LaTeX's NFSS (new font selection scheme) is preferable
for the ordinary user and has great advantages in daily use. All you need to do
is to integrate the fonts into your LaTeX system. Probably you will need to
create your own LaTeX font adaptation where the `fontinst` utility is of great
help. Try your favorite search engine on that topic to learn more about it and
find some step by step guides. As soon as your LaTeX system is configured to
use your fonts they will also be available to PyX.
