Stroke and fill paths at the same time

To stroke and fill a path you could call the `fill` and `stroke` methods of a
canvas instance one after the other. However, such a solution is not optimal,
since the path would be written into the output file twice. Instead you can use
the `filled` decorator within a `stroke` method call as an additional
attribute. ...

As shown in the example the filled decorator can be called to pass additional
styles, which will then only be used for the fill operation. Other styles
passed in the second argument of the `stroke` method are used for both, the
stroke and the fill operation. Here we set a linewidth, which only affect the
stroke operation.

There is a similar functionality the other way around: you can use a
`deco.stroked` instance to add a stroke operation within a `fill` method call.

! The `filled` and `stroked` are already instances, but they accept a ''modify
by call'' operation. This is a common feature of decorators and other
attributes.

!! Internally the `stroke` and the `fill` methods are implemented by adding
either `deco.stroked` or `deco.filled` to the list passed as the second
parameter to the `stroke` or `fill` method of a canvas. This whole construction
is then evaluated by the `draw` method of the canvas instance. The draw method
is the real basic operation to output a path. What it does is to transform a
path into a so-called ''decorated path''. The path itself is a pure
mathematical object without any information about how it should be drawn and
that styles should be applied. Output specific properties like dashing or the
linewidth are not attached to the path at all. Instead, the decorated path
attaches the mathematical path object with styles and the two output operations
stroke and fill. A symmetric stroke and fill operation therefore looks like

    c.draw(p, l1 + [deco.stroked(l2), deco.filled(l3)])

where `c` is the canvas instance, `p` is the path to be stroked and filled,
`l1` is a list of styles used for both stroking and filling, `l2` are
additional styles used for stroking, and `l3` are additional styles used for
filling.
