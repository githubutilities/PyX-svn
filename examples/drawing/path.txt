Basic paths

This first path example shows you how to create a canvas, how to draw some
simple geometric objects onto it and how to write the result into a PostScript
or PDF file. ...

First we import all top-level symbols of the PyX package by the usual Python
import statement. In the further examples we'll always use this form of the
import statement to make the PyX package available to our scripts.

After that we can create a canvas instance `c`, where our basic paths are to be
drawn at. The later is done by passing some path instances (a line, a rectangle
and a circle) to the `strokes` or `fill` methods of the canvas instance we just
created and stored in the variable `c`. Finally we can call the `writeEPSfile`
and `writePDFfile` methods of the canvas to create an Encapsulated PostScript
and a PDF file for our drawing. While typically you'll only create either a
PostScript or a PDF file, in our examples we always create both output formats
to have them both available for download.

This example additionally shows some basics of the PyX coordinate system. The
first coordinate (often referred to as `x`) goes horizontally from left to right
and the second coordinate (`y`) goes perpendicular to that vertically from the
bottom to the top. The default unit is `1 cm`. The boundary of the resulting
image is calculated automatically.
