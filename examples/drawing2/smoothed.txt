Smoothing paths

This example shows how to use the `deformer` class. A deformer takes an
original path and return a modified one, which is here a smoothed variant. The
deformer can be used like any other attribute when stroking or filling a path.
...

In the example code, the original curve comprises a straight line and a curve,
exhibiting a sharp corner in between. This sharp corner is smoothed away.

! The deformed path can be accessed directly from the deformer by

  ps = deformer.smoothed(1.0).deform(p)
