Paths with constant distance

This example shows how to use the `deformer.parallel` class. It provides the
path which has always constant (signed) distance to an original path. ...

! Note that the order of the deformer attributes is not arbitrary, since the
deforming operations do not commute. If you want first to smooth and then get
the parallel curve to the smoothed curve, you have to say

  [deformer.smoothed(radius), deformer.parallel(dist)]

since the stroke attributes are evaluated from left to right.
