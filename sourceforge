PyX is a python package to create encapsulated postscript figures. It provides
classes and methods to access basic postscript functionality at an abstract
level. At the same time the emerging structures are very convenient to produce
all kind of drawings in a non-interactive way. In combination with the python
language itself the user can just code any complexity of the figure wanted.
Additionally the integration of a TeX/LaTeX interface into PyX leads to the
famous high quality typesetting within the figures.

A major part of PyX on top of the already discribed functionallity is the
provision of high level functionallity for complex tasks like 2d plots in
publication-ready quality.

The project started mid of last year and is developed by Jörg Lehmann and André
Wobst. While we want to use pyx ourself (and already do) we want to take the
opportunity to share our project with others under the GPL. We would greatly
appreciate sourceforge for the hosting of this project.

PyX is a python package to create encapsulated postscript figures. As
basic functionality it provides both an abstraction of PostScript 
- abtraction of postscript in python classes
- TeX/LaTeX interface
- 2d plots

> 5. Project Unix Name
> 
> In addition to full project name, you will need to choose short, "Unix" name for your project.
> 
> The "Unix Name" has several restrictions because it is used in so many places around the site. They are:
> 
>     * Cannot match the unix name of any other project
>     * Must be between 3 and 15 characters in length
>     * Must be in lower case
>     * Can only contain characters, numbers, and dashes
>     * Must be a valid unix username
>     * Cannot match one of our reserved domains
>     * Unix name will never change for this project
> 
> Your unix name is important, however, because it will be used for many things, including:
> 
>     * A web site at unixname.sourceforge.net
>     * A CVS Repository root of /cvsroot/unixname at cvs.unixname.sourceforge.net
>     * Shell access to unixname.sourceforge.net
>     * Search engines throughout the site
