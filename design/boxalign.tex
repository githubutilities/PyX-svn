\noindent\textbf{\huge Relative box alignment}\medskip
\section{Introduction}
The relative alignment of boxes is an important part in many drawing
tasks. At the moment the main focus is the flexible alignment of text,
because it is an essential ingredience for the drawing of axes in the
graph module. Therefore, the implementation is part of the graph
module at the moment, but the alignment of any kind of boxes is
expected be become of general interest in the future. Later on it will
certainly become a module for itself. Alternatively the alignment
techniques might become a feature of path elements, which sounds quite
sophisticated but it might turn out to be inadequate.

We consider boxes to be two dimensional convex polygons. We may
introduce round corners and other goodies later on, but for the moment
polygons are everything we are in need for.

The relative alignment takes place respecting an alignment vector
$\vec a$. The box has a central point $\vec c$, which can be placed
anywhere within the polygon. Otherwise some alignment requests might
fail or result in unexpected alignments. An alignment request has to
calculate a translation vector $t$ so that the center point is on the
line defined by the alignment vector.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:center}
\alpha\vec a=\vec c+\vec t
\end{equation}
The alignment vector $\vec a$ is described by a normalized direction
vector, which is provided as a tuple \verb|(dx, dy)| to the alignment
routine. The absolute value of the alignment vector is given by
\verb|a| and might be zero or even negative. The distance of the box
is calculated out of the alignment vector so that an additional
alignment condition is met.

The task of box alignment is splitted into the task of aligning a line
segment (a segment of the polygon). The polygon and thus the line
segments are considered to be vectored in mathematically positive
orientation. Thus the alignment request for a line segment predefines
a half space. It might happen, that the alignment of a line segment
is restrained by the finite length of the segment in that way, that
the alignment should take place based on an end point of the line
segment. When this happens for the end point of a line segment and a
starting of the following line segment, this very point has to be
considered for the alignment.

\section{Alignment Primitives}
\subsection{Align a point relative to an infinite line}
The point $\vec p$ should be aligned at the dotted line:

\centerline{\includegraphics{boxalignpal}}

We introduce the normalized tangential vector $\vec b$ to the
alignment vector $\vec a$, $\vec b\perp\vec a$.

The solution is defined by equation~(\ref{eq:center}) and
\begin{equation}
\vec a+\beta\vec b=\vec p+\vec t\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Align a line segment relative to an infinite line}
The line segment has to be perpendicular to the alignment vector.
We can than continue as in section \ref{s:calignline}. However, if the
line segment is not perpendicular to the alignment vector, the
starting point or end point of the line segment (whichever is closer
in terms of the aligment direction) should be considered for the
alignment.

\subsection{Align a point relative to a circle}
The point $\vec p$ should be aligned at the dotted circle:

\centerline{\includegraphics{boxalignpac}}

The solution is defined by equation~(\ref{eq:center}) and
\begin{equation}
|\vec a|=|\vec p+\vec t|\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Align a line segment relative to a circle}
\label{s:calignline}
The line segment between the points $\vec e$ and $\vec f$ should have
a single point of contact with the dotted circle:

\centerline{\includegraphics{boxalignlac}}

We introduce $\vec g=\vec e-\vec f$. Thus the line segment is
described by $\vec e-\beta \vec g$ for $\beta=[0;1]$. We introduce the
vector $\vec b$ and ask for $\vec b\perp\vec g$. Therefore $\vec b$ is
the contract point and it can be calculated by
\begin{equation}
\vec b=|\vec a|\frac{\vec a-\frac{\vec a\vec g}{\vec g\vec g}\vec g}
                    {\left|\vec a-\frac{\vec a\vec g}{\vec g\vec g}\vec g\right|}\,.
\end{equation}
We can neglect solutions where the z-component of $\vec b\times\vec g$
is negative in order to restrict the solution to a half space.

The solution is defined by equation~(\ref{eq:center}) and
\begin{equation}
\vec b=\vec e-\beta\vec g+\vec t\,.
\end{equation}

The solution has to fullfill the condition $\beta=[0;1]$, otherwise
the starting point ($\beta<0$) or end point ($\beta>1$) of the line
segment should be considered for the alignment.
