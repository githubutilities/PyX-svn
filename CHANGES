PyX

0.3 (????/??/??):
  - examples
    - new easy to use example generation (will hopefully lead to nice examples)
  - unit box:
    - new module for handling of convex polygons (taken out of the graph module)
  - unit helper:
    - collection of helper functions (taken out of the graph module)
    - moved the attrlist into helper -- as plain functions; attrlist becomes obsolete
  - text module:
    - to be included in 0.3 -> finish base functionality
    - documentation!!!
  - t1strip module:
    - strip glyphs from pfa/pfb-fonts
    - there is a C implementation taken from pdftex
    - fallback solution via an external program (pfb2pfa --- included in teTeX???, not in MikTeX???)
  - pykpathsea module:
    - (partial) C binding to libkpathsea
    - fallback solution via an external program (kpsewhich)
  - graph module:
    - removed some code duplication (various axis painters)
    - use text module instead of the obsolete tex module (done, check the documentation)
    - allow for tailing zeros of automatic generated labels (done up to documentation)
    - allow for missing data in bar graphs
      (not yet tested --- check skat graph; check, whether this change needs to be documented in the manual)
    - TODO: remove the support for variables given within the argument dictionary in data constructor
    - TODO: graph keys; titles in data/function/etc.
    - TODO: 3d graphs --- leave it for pyx-0.4
    - TODO: exceptions in drawsymbol & friends...
  - unit module:
    - new classes for visual and width lengths, aliases for user length (u_pt = pt)
    - all length classes have now by default a quantifier 1 (instead of 0), such that, 
      for instance, 5*unit.t_cm() == unit.t_cm(5)
    - default_unit now has to be set via unit.set. For instance: unit.set(default_unit="m").
  - bbox module:
    - new methods height and width
    - TODO: document me!
  - data module:
    - TODO: line reduction for datafile like the every parameter in gnuplot
  - canvas module:
    - new way of PS prolog generation that writes only necessary parts
    - added support for patterns
    - canvas.insert() now supports arguments
    - TODO: document patterns
    - TODO: document new canvas.insert()
  - mathtree module:
    - added abs function
  - numerous bugfixes:
    - problem with sizefile on windows (tex module)
    - allow for strings in graphxy's width and height; allow for width only (graph module)
    - disable rating for labelattrs equals None (graph module)
    - TODO: defaultstyle selection, when a list of data is provided to the plot function (graph module)
    - traverse when adding functions as arguments of operators (mathtree module)
    - allow for extern functions in addcolumn (data module)
    - just one common place for the version number
    - ...

0.2 (2003/01/17):
  - unit module:
    - allow division of length by numbers
  - trafo module:
    - new transformation: slant
    - renamed all trafo methods to use the participle (i.e translate->translated)
    - the name of all trafo subclasses are verbs (i.e. translation->translate)
  - graph module:
    - mark class renamed to symbol
    - (text-)box distance measurement
    - moved axis partitioning to axis and axis painter
    - automatic axis partitioning (now officially: general cleanup, distance measurement, documentation)
    - splitaxis
    - baraxis, baraxispainter, and bar style
  - data module:
    - previously named datafile module
    - class "_datafile" renamed to class "data"
    - class sectionfile added
    - testsuite
  - mathtree module:
    - extern variables and functions (support in graph.function, graph.paramfunction and data.data)
    - testsuite
  - text module:
    - deferred to Version 0.3
    - running TeX "on the fly" is basically implemented
  - numerous bugfixes:
    - transformation bug (#624068, trafo module)
    - canvas transformations (canvas module???)
    - textbox alignment (graph module)
    - return linewidth upon calculation with linewidths (unit module)
    - allow column number variables with several digits
